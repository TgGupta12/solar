3D Solar System Simulation
Project Overview

This project is a 3D simulation of the Solar System built using Three.js.
It allows users to interactively explore planets, visualize their orbits, and learn about planetary facts. 
The application includes camera controls, dynamic animations, orbital speed customization, and an immersive space environment.

 Objectives

- Build a visually appealing 3D representation of the solar system
- Implement planetary orbits, rotations, and inclinations
- Enable user interaction.
- Provide a UI to control animation and revolution speeds

- [Three.js](w) for 3D rendering
- [OrbitControls](w) for user navigation
- [HTML5](w), [CSS3](w), and [JavaScript (ES6)](w)
- [Skypack CDN](w) for ES module support in the browser
